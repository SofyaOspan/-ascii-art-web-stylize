    -The different banner styles provided by the ascii-art application must be available for selection on the website.
    -The appropriate HTTP methods should be used for handling requests.
    -The server and client must establish a well-defined connection.

Learning Goals:

    -Creating a web server in Go.
    -Following good coding practices.
    -Implementing Docker for containerization.
    -Creating a Dockerfile that adheres to Docker best practices.

Instructions:

    -Properly handle website errors, including 400, 404, and 500 status codes.
